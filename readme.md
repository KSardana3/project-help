# What should your document contain

__In your own words.__

* An explanation of the key points of the problem

* Description of methods used to solve the problem
	* Algorithms you learned! And perhaps some we didn't have time to go over

* When the methods fail and when they do well
	* For example, conditioning can play a role here

* Examples of edge cases or special cases of the problem. 
	* For example, solving banded matrices is a "special case" of solving a linear system.

* Compact pseudocode for key algorithms in the topic you chose

* Appropriate paper and book references at the bottom of the document. Use APA style (see below).
