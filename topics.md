1. 
	* Floating point number systems and their arithmetic
	* Backward and forward errors. Include how they can be used to compute stability of an algorithm, the relative pitfalls of each, and how they are used in practice.

2. 
	* Systems of linear equations
		* Solution methods for general linear systems (assume no knowledge of the matrix $A$ is known. Include discussion of conditioning, sensitivity.
		* Solution methods for "special" types of linear systems, including tridiagonal, SPD, and symmetric. Including conditioning, sensitivity.
		* Software for linear equations, LAPACK, BLAS, and vendor-specific varieties on them. How they are used.
