# Topics to choose from (34)

The below are listed by chapter. 

1.  Scientific Computing
	1. Floating point number systems and their arithmetic
	2. Backward and forward errors. Include how they can be used to compute stability of an algorithm, the relative pitfalls of each, and how they are used in practice.

2. Systems of linear equations
	1. Solution methods for general linear systems (assume no knowledge of the matrix $A$ is known. Include discussion of conditioning, sensitivity.
	2. Solution methods for "special" types of linear systems, including tridiagonal, SPD, and symmetric. Including conditioning, sensitivity.
	3. Software for linear equations, LAPACK, BLAS, and vendor-specific varieties on them. How they are used. 

3. Linear least squares
	1. The normal equations. What they are, what you are used for, what the problem with them is, when one might consider using them, why one might learn about them.
	2. Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (standard and motified versions), including potential for loss of orthogonality. What problems it is and is not practical for.
	3. The SVD. What is it, what it can be used for, how it can be computed.
